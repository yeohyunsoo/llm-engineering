But since the worm starts at the first page, it must gnaw through the rest of V1 up to its back cover, then through the space between volumes (the gap between the back cover of V1 and the front cover of V2 is zero if they are touching? They are on a shelf with no gap; but there is a leaf orientation.)\n",

       "  - The rest of Volume 1 pages from first page to back cover: that is full 20 mm pages minus the first page thickness? But page thickness is not given; the pages total thickness is 20 mm. Starting at the first page means you need to gnaw through the rest of Volume 1's pages up to its back cover: that's the entire 20 mm of V1 pages.\n",
       "  - Then through the back cover of Volume 1: 2 mm.\n",
       "  - The space between volumes on the shelf: usually 0 if they are touching; but the volumes are side by side with no gap, so the worm would go into Volume 2 through its front cover? After back cover of V1, the next object is the front cover of V2, if the two volumes are directly adjacent front-to-front? Actually arrangement: Volume 1 then Volume 2, both with covers oriented outward. The order on shelf: [Front cover of V1] [Pages of V1] [Back cover of V1] [Front cover of V2] [Pages of V2] [Back cover of V2]. If worm goes from first page of V1 to last page of V2, path would go from inside V1 through back cover of V1, then through front cover of V2, then through all pages of V2 up to last page.

       "This is a classic riddle that plays on our assumptions about how books are arranged on a shelf. Here is the step-by-step solution:\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Visualize the Books:** Imagine the two volumes standing side by side on the bookshelf in the correct order: Volume 1 on the left, and Volume 2 on the right.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **Identify the Parts:** From left to right on the shelf, the physical order of the book parts is:\n",
       "    *   Front cover of Volume 1\n",
       "    *   The pages of Volume 1\n",
       "    *   Back cover of Volume 1\n",
       "    *   Front cover of Volume 2\n",
       "    *   The pages of Volume 2\n",
       "    *   Back cover of Volume 2\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Pinpoint the Worm's Start and End:**\n",
       "    *   The worm starts at the **first page of Volume 1**.\n",
       "    *   The worm ends at the **last page of Volume 2**.\n",
       "\n",
       "4.  **The Trick:** Here's the crucial part. Where are those specific pages located?\n",
       "    *   When a book is on a shelf, its \"first page\" is on the right side of the page block, right next to the front cover. This means it is physically adjacent to the book next to it (Volume 2).\n",
       "    *   Similarly, the \"last page\" of Volume 2 is on the left side of its page block, right next to its back cover.\n",
       "\n",
       "    Let's re-examine the order on the shelf with this in mind:\n",
       "    *   The first page of Volume 1 is physically located right next to the back cover of Volume 1.\n",
       "    *   The last page of Volume 2 is physically located right next to the front cover of Volume 2.\n",
       "\n",
       "    The worm's path is from the first page of Volume 1 to the last page of Volume 2. The only things standing between these two pages are the two covers that are touching in the middle:\n",
       "    *   The back cover of Volume 1\n",
       "    *   The front cover of Volume 2\n",
       "\n",
       "5.  **Calculate the Distance:**\n",
       "    The worm gnaws through these two covers. Each cover is 2 mm thick.\n",
       "\n",
       "    *   Distance = (Thickness of Volume 1's back cover) + (Thickness of Volume 2's front cover)\n",
       "    *   Distance = 2 mm + 2 mm = 4 mm\n",
       "\n",
       "The worm gnawed a distance of **4 mm**. The 2 cm thickness of the pages is extra information designed to mislead you."
