       "\n",
       "4. **Maintain Transparent and Open Communication:** Be open about the capabilities and limitations of AI agents to build trust with users and stakeholders.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Consider Ethical and Societal Impact:** Founders should think deeply about how AI agents affect privacy, fairness, and societal structures, aiming to maximize positive outcomes and minimize negative consequences.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Collaborate and Share Knowledge:** Encourage collaboration across the AI community to address challenges collectively and accelerate beneficial advancements.\n",
