Rather, I execute Jupyter Labs, like this, and give you an intuition for what's going on. My suggestion is that you carefully execute this yourself, <b>after</b> watching the lecture. Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations. If you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations. Not only is this essential practice, but it demonstrates your skills to others, including perhaps future clients or employers...</span>\n",

We'll do fun things like have LLMs tell jokes and argue with each other. But fundamentally, my goal is to teach skills you can apply in business. I'll explain business implications as we go, and it's worth keeping this in mind: as you build experience with models and techniques, think of ways you could put this into action at work today. Please do contact me if you'd like to discuss more or if you have ideas to bounce off me.</span>\n",

No standalone, verifiable company announcements are provided on this page itself.\\n  - Action: check Nebula.io’s official site, LinkedIn, and reputable press outlets for any new funding, product updates, or customer wins to confirm current status.\\n\\n- Is this a product to buy?\\n  - Direct purchasing information is not offered on this site. It serves as a personal portfolio, blog, and pointer to Nebula.io’s platform.\\n  - If you’re considering Nebula.io for talent recruitment, you’ll need to obtain a proper product demo, pricing, security/compliance details, and customer references beyond this site.\\n  - If you’re seeking learning resources, you can view Ed’s posts and courses mentioned here, but verify course access/details from official course pages or providers.\\n\\n- Bottom-line\\n  - The site is a useful pointer to Ed Donner’s AI-focused work, experiments, and educational material, with occasional glimpses into Nebula.io’s recruitment platform. For a purchase decision, rely on independent product information, demos, and verifiable customer references rather than this personal site alone.'"

       "- Quick read of the site\n",
       "  - It’s the personal site of Edward Donner, a tech founder and CTO of Nebula.io. The site blends a short bio, project sections (Connect Four and Outsmart), a blog/Posts area with several 2025 entries, and links to Nebula.io, Ed’s courses, and social profiles.\n",
       "  - Core business claim on the site: Nebula.io runs a talent platform that uses proprietary, vertical LLMs and a patented talent-matching model to help recruiters source, understand, engage, and manage talent. The site asserts “happy customers” and “tons of press coverage,” but it does not provide concrete case studies, logos, pricing, or performance metrics on the page.\n",
       "\n",
       "- What value you could get\n",
       "  - For talent/recruiting buyers or organizations exploring AI-driven hiring:\n",
       "    - A claim of a vertically specialized LLM approach for recruiting plus a patented matching model. If true and backed by actual customers, this could potentially reduce time-to-fill and improve candidate fit.\n",
       "    - A signaling of credibility through references to awards and press coverage (though no specifics are provided on the site).\n",
       "  - For learners and practitioners:\n",
       "    - Access to Ed’s writings and courses on LLMs, agentic AI, and AI engineering, plus a newsletter. The courses and executive briefings may be useful if you want structured learning paths.\n",
       "\n",
       "- What to verify before considering a purchase\n",
       "  - Customer proof points: request case studies, logos, and references to validate claims of “happy customers” and real ROI.\n",
       "  - Product details: details on the Nebula.io platform, pricing, deployment options, data privacy/security, integration capabilities, and support.\n",
       "  - Maturity and support: onboarding process, service levels, and roadmaps for the patented matching model and vertical LLMs.\n",
       "  - External credibility: look up Nebula.io in press releases, funding rounds, partnerships, or analyst coverage to corroborate the on-site claims.\n",
       "\n",
       "- News and announcements found on the site (as of the page content)\n",
       "  - On-site announcements (2025):\n",
       "    - AI in Production: Gen AI and Agentic AI on AWS at scale — Sept 15, 2025\n",
       "    - Connecting my courses – become an LLM expert and leader — May 28, 2025\n",
       "    - 2025 AI Executive Briefing — May 18, 2025\n",
       "    - The Complete Agentic AI Engineering Course — Apr 21, 2025\n",
       "  - Observations:\n",
       "    - These appear to be personal/blog-style announcements and course offerings rather than external press releases about Nebula.io.\n",
       "    - There is a reference to untapt being acquired in 2021 (historical background) and mention of a patented matching model, but no recent public disclosures about Nebula.io funding, customers, or partnerships on the page.\n",
       "  - What this means for a buyer:\n",
       "    - The site signals ongoing activity and thought leadership in AI, plus educational resources, but it does not provide new external confirmations about product traction or enterprise deals. You’d want to confirm current company status with Nebula.io directly and look for independent news or customer references.\n",
       "\n",
       "- Bottom line\n",
       "  - The site positions Edward Donner as an AI/LLM expert with a talent-platform angle through Nebula.io, plus his own educational content. If you’re evaluating Nebula.io for talent recruiting, this site is a starting point for credibility but lacks concrete buyer proof (case studies, pricing, SLA details). Do direct due diligence: request a product demo, customer references, security/privacy details, and independent news coverage to assess real-world value."

       "**Brief rundown of the site**\n",
       "\n",
       "- Company and product focus: Anthropic markets Claude, a family of AI models with a strong emphasis on safety, governance, and long-term well-being. The site bundles research, policy, and developer tools around Claude (including Claude, Claude Code, and Claude Developer Platform), plus a Trust Center and security/compliance resources.\n",
       "- Core value proposition: Safety-first AI development with a public benefit orientation. They highlight responsible scaling, transparency, and policy around AI risk as foundational to their offerings.\n",
       "- What you can buy/try: Access to Claude via the Claude platform, with specific product lines for coding (Claude Code) and agents (Claude Sonnet, Haiku variants noted in announcements). There are developer tools, documentation, pricing, and “Try Claude” options.\n",
       "- Signals about usability and focus: The site stresses governance, safety rails, and compliance, aiming at enterprise or regulated use cases that want guardrails and accountability in AI.\n",
       "\n",
       "**What the site is likely to be best for you if you’re evaluating it**\n",
       "\n",
       "- If you are a developer or business needing an AI that prioritizes safety, policy controls, and auditability, Anthropic’s Claude ecosystem could be compelling.\n",
       "- The value proposition leans toward controlled AI behavior, transparency around how models are guided, and tools aimed at building reliable, safer AI-powered applications.\n",
       "- Potential caveats to consider: the emphasis on safety and policy can imply stricter guardrails and potentially more conservative outputs or higher latency. Pricing and deployment considerations (region availability, API limits, enterprise terms) should be checked in detail.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Recent announcements visible on the site**\n",
       "\n",
       "- Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Claude Haiku 4.5 are highlighted as new model announcements, described as optimizations for agents, coding, and managing context on the Claude Developer Platform. The language on these items emphasizes safety-oriented improvements and better context handling.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Latest company news and context (what to look up for up-to-date info)**\n",
       "\n",
       "- Anthropic is a safety- and research-driven AI company behind Claude, often releasing model updates and publishing policy/safety work. In recent years they have pursued partnerships with cloud providers and enterprise customers to scale safe AI deployments, and they publicly emphasize constitutional AI, safety methodologies, and transparency commitments.\n",
       "- For the very latest developments, check Anthropic’s News page, press releases, and their official blog. This will show the newest Claude updates, platform enhancements, and any new partnerships or regulatory/policy initiatives.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Bottom line**\n",
       "\n",
       "- The site presents Anthropic as a safety-forward AI vendor with a full ecosystem around Claude, aimed at developers and enterprises that value governance, compliance, and trustworthy AI behavior.\n",
       "- If your priority is cutting-edge raw capability with fewer guardrails, this might feel more constrained than some competitors; if safety, auditability, and public-benefit alignment are critical for you, Anthropic’s offering could be a strong fit.\n",
       "- Verify current pricing, availability in your region, and the exact safety features or guardrails you need by reviewing the latest product docs and announcements on their site."
