    "\n",
    "The answer: this is an example of a \"hyper-parameter\". In other words, it's basically trial and error! We want a sufficiently large number of tokens so that we have enough useful information to gauge the price. But we also want to keep the number low so that we can train efficiently. You'll see this in action in Week 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "I started with a number that seemed reasonable, and experimented with a few variations before settling on 180. If you have time, you should do the same! You might find that you can beat my results by finding a better balance. This kind of trial-and-error might sound a bit unsatisfactory, but it's a crucial part of the data science R&D process.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's another interesting reason why we might favor a lower number of tokens in the training data. When we eventually get to use our model at inference time, we'll want to provide new products and have it estimate a price. And we'll be using short descriptions of products - like 1-2 sentences. For best performance, we should size our training data to be similar to the inputs we will provide at inference time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## But I see in items.py it constrains inputs to 160 tokens?\n",
    "\n",
    "Another great question from Moataz A.! The description of the products is limited to 160 tokens because we add some more text before and after the description to turn it into a prompt. That brings it to around 180 tokens in total.\n",
